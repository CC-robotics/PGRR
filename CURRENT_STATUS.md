# Current status

## Gate 0 — environment (accepted)

### Completed

- Read-only host preflight: Ubuntu 22.04.5, 62 GiB RAM, 442 GiB free disk, RTX 5090, ROS2 Humble present.
- Created a new Git repository on `teacher/reference`; no pre-existing target files were overwritten.
- Created `ramp-offline` with Python 3.10 and dual dependency locks.
- Validated Torch 2.13.0 + CUDA 13.0 on the RTX 5090.
- Passed Ruff, formatting, mypy, and 2 offline unit tests.
- Installed the pinned Arena Humble fallback in the isolated `ramp-arena:humble` image without modifying host ROS.
- Built 48 Arena overlay source packages on the binary Humble base and selected Gazebo 8.14.0, Jackal, and DWB.
- Passed the automated Xvfb/software-rendered Arena smoke test.

### Commands

```bash
make preflight
make conda
make arena
make smoke
make test
```

### Acceptance results

- Host resource recommendations: PASS.
- ROS environment isolation: PASS; runtime reports Humble and system `bondcpp` while the invoking shell remains untouched.
- Offline environment isolation: PASS; inherited ROS Python paths are cleared and regression-tested.
- Arena smoke test: PASS. `/clock`, TF, LaserScan, Odometry, and NavigateToPose were discovered; one Nav2 goal was accepted; controlled cleanup completed.

### Failures

- The invoking shell had Conda base active and ROS Iron selected. Runtime scripts must clear this and source Humble explicitly.
- Native Arena installation needs sudo and the official installer contains a broad `$HOME/.pyenv` removal, so it was contained with Docker `runc`.
- The official Humble profile provides Gazebo rather than Flatland. The main simulator for this profile is therefore Gazebo; this is a recorded platform fallback, not a claimed Flatland result.
- The smoke goal was accepted but later aborted; static point-goal success is deliberately left for Gate 1 rather than misreported here.

### Next

Gate 1: add the modular core/ML/ROS architecture, build the project overlay, run a successful static navigation episode, add logging, and compile deterministic dynamic stress scenarios.
