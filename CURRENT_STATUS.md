# Current status

## Gate 1 — classical baseline (in progress)

### Completed

- Read-only host preflight: Ubuntu 22.04.5, 62 GiB RAM, 442 GiB free disk, RTX 5090, ROS2 Humble present.
- Created a new Git repository on `teacher/reference`; no pre-existing target files were overwritten.
- Created `ramp-offline` with Python 3.10 and dual dependency locks.
- Validated Torch 2.13.0 + CUDA 13.0 on the RTX 5090.
- Passed Ruff, formatting, mypy, and 2 offline unit tests.
- Installed the pinned Arena Humble fallback in the isolated `ramp-arena:humble` image without modifying host ROS.
- Built 48 Arena overlay source packages on the binary Humble base and selected Gazebo 8.14.0, Jackal, and DWB.
- Passed the automated Xvfb/software-rendered Arena smoke test.
- Added and tested ROS-independent geometry, occupancy, differential-drive, braking, A*, Pure Pursuit, observation, action-mask, and recovery-state primitives.
- Added the fixed 25-action contract and YAML IDs.
- Built `ramp_msgs`, `ramp_ros`, and `ramp_bringup`; `colcon test-result` reports zero failures.
- Passed static PointGoal navigation with DWB and a task-generated goal (`GOAL_REACHED`).
- Compiled 72 deterministic stress scenarios (8 families x 3 densities x 3 splits), with split-safe manifests and previews; all parse and load through the installed Arena schema.
- Added an online JSONL episode logger plus validated multi-episode HDF5 conversion with public/privileged field separation.
- Passed a single-agent dynamic episode (`GOAL_REACHED`, 158 samples) and reproduced a non-simulator multi-agent collision (`COLLISION`, 532 samples).

```

### Acceptance results

- Host resource recommendations: PASS.
- ROS environment isolation: PASS; runtime reports Humble and system `bondcpp` while the invoking shell remains untouched.
- Offline environment isolation: PASS; inherited ROS Python paths are cleared and regression-tested.
- Arena smoke test: PASS. `/clock`, TF, LaserScan, Odometry, and NavigateToPose were discovered; one Nav2 goal was accepted; controlled cleanup completed.
- Offline architecture tests: PASS, including deterministic scenario and HDF5 regression coverage; Ruff, format check, and strict mypy pass.
- Project ROS overlay: PASS, 3 packages built; colcon reports 0 errors and 0 failures.
- Static navigation: PASS, `GOAL_REACHED`.
- Single-agent dynamic navigation: PASS, `GOAL_REACHED`, 15.6843 simulated seconds.
- Multi-agent failure reproduction: PASS, `COLLISION` at 0.6852 m center distance; not a simulator failure.
- Scenario catalog: PASS, 72 generated stress files plus acceptance fixtures; train/validation/test IDs are disjoint.
- Gate 1 full acceptance: pending 10-seed failure-rate mining for the three core families.

### Failures

- The invoking shell had Conda base active and ROS Iron selected. Runtime scripts must clear this and source Humble explicitly.
- Native Arena installation needs sudo and the official installer contains a broad `$HOME/.pyenv` removal, so it was contained with Docker `runc`.
- The official Humble profile provides Gazebo rather than Flatland. The main simulator for this profile is therefore Gazebo; this is a recorded platform fallback, not a claimed Flatland result.
- The smoke goal was accepted but later aborted; static point-goal success is deliberately left for Gate 1 rather than misreported here.
- The pinned Arena source references a Gazebo HuNav plugin absent from its installer and depending on an unpublished `arena_people_msgs` package. Dynamic runs use the documented Gazebo kinematic proxy fallback and are not labeled as HuNav social-force runs.

### Next

Finish Gate 1 by mining 10 fixed seeds for `head_on_corridor`, `doorway_bottleneck`, and `crossing_flow`, then implement rule-based failure labels and the heuristic recovery MVP.
